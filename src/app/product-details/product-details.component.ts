//The product details component handles the display of each product. The Angular Router displays components based on the browser's URL and your defined routes. This section shows you how to use the Angular Router to combine the products data and route information to display the specific details for each product.

//   The ActivatedRoute is specific to each routed component that the Angular Router loads. It contains information about the route, its parameters, and additional data associated with the route.
